i.  Web application instructions are as follows: Use any of the different categories of updates
    to make changes to the database, whether it's adding a new student, updating a lease, or
    adding a newly employed staff member. There are also five queries that can be performed. Choose
    from any of them at the top of the page. If a student cheats on a final exam, you can even
    obliterate them from the database with our delete option.
